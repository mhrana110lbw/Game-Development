        <p>There's a definite knack to clearing a bouncing bridge with both speed and grace. Don't leave the bridge at full speed or you'll very likely take a fatal tumble. Instead, you should be braking well in advance of clearing the last plank. Just don't brake too sharply or you'll face the same precarious problem.</p>

        <h2>Marketing Approach</h2>
        <p>Fingersoft focuses its marketing efforts in three areas:<br>

            Using all their existing apps to promote their other apps<br>
            Maintain an active and growing social presence, for example with more than 1 million likes on Facebook, which they use to inform users of new versions and new features<br>
            Try to attain a very high review score, more than 4.5, which enables them to be among the best rated apps, which drives additional downloads.</p>
        <h2>Monetization Strategy</h2>
        <h3>In App Purchase</h3>
        <p>This morning we published our review of Fingersoft's Hill Climb Racing, an eccentric but loveable physics racing game. If you're struggling to nail a high-score, here are all of our top hints and tips for getting ahead in the game.</p>
        <p>The in-app purchase success in this game is driven largely by their execution: show the in-app purchase at the right moment in the game, make it easy to purchase new coins, offer multiple purchase options to cater to all types of users, and the benefits are clearly visible at all times in the game (car enhancements, new cars, new stages). Price discounts and promotions can be used to drive additional purchases.</p>
        <h3>AdMob revs up income</h3>
        <p>When it came to generating income for ‘Hill Climb Racing,’ Fingersoft, once again, put AdMob top of the list to connect with advertisers looking to reach users across platforms, including Android and iOS. For Fingerroos, AdMob is considered the foundation of app monetisation and promotion. For Toni, AdMob made sense because it is the biggest ad network for mobile apps, with tens of thousands of advertisers, and it had produced reliable income for him in the past.</p>
        <p>For My Game the Fingersoft team kept its AdMob strategies and formats simple: the company used only banner ads and placed them at the bottom of the screen to be less obtrusive. If players wish, they can purchase coins and hide ads altogether. The company uses other mobile ad networks in addition to AdMob to augment income for its apps, but considers AdMob the cornerstone. “AdMob has a fill rate reaching close to 100% and great eCPM, so AdMob is really a necessity for us in making money on our free apps,” says Fingerroos. “We never need to worry about unfilled impressions and can reach massive download counts quickly. AdMob makes it easy to scale and monetise quickly.”</p>
        <h3>Maximal income</h3>
        <p>To keep users satisfied, Fingersoft keeps a pulse on their comments on social channels as well as on app marketplaces such as Google Play. The app then adjusts code for the game accordingly. Users also can share their results from playing the game on social media networks, and this, in turn, drives new downloads.</p>
        <p>For ‘Hill Climb Racing,’ success relies on engaging large numbers of players and garnering significant eCPM value, with AdMob being the pivotal advertising medium. The income from coin purchases and advertising allows the Fingersoft team to develop new apps and games. “AdMob is a solid platform that is exceptionally easy to use,” says Fingerroos. “The AdMob income, which is substantial, started coming in right away. I was very surprised and pleased, especially because our marketing budget is zero today.”</p>
